Kernel configuration
--------------------

Configure (with menuconfig) and exit afterwards:

    MENUCONFIG=1 makepkg

The configuration will be in `src/linux-3.*/.config`. In the PKGBUILDs build
function (line 81 ff.), the configuration interface is changeable.

To configure and build the kernel afterwards:

    MENUCONFIG=2 makepkg


grsecurity option configuration
-------------------------------

Many options are configurable by sysctl in `/etc/sysctl.d/05-grsecurity.conf`.
After `kernel.grsecurity.grsec_lock` is activated, there are no changes possible
anymore.

If you do not use KMS graphics, you have to disable
`kernel.grsecurity.disable_priv_io`.

There are five groups, which control grsecurity functions:

* proc-trusted
* socket-deny-all
* socket-deny-client
* socket-deny-server 
* tpe-trusted
